            <h4> Ingredients</h4> 
            <li>Steak</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>French Fries</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h4>Steps to cook the perfect wagyu</h2>
        <p><ol>
            <li>Let it come to room temperature before cooking. Take the meat out of the fridge about 30 minutes before cooking</li>
            <li>Season simply. To really taste the flavours of the meat, we suggest sticking with salt and pepper to start.</li>
            <li>Fire up your grill (or skillet)! If using a skillet, turn on high heat.</li>
            <li>Sear each side for three to four minutes, depending on how well you like them done. For a rarer cook, sear for about 3 minutes. For medium doneness, cook for about for four minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Let â€™em rest. Remove the pan and set aside to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. This will allow the juices to flow back through the meat.</li>
